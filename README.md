# Kickstart - Crowdfunding with Blockchain

Welcome to Kickstart, a global crowdfunding platform that harnesses the power of creativity and blockchain technology. Our platform enables innovators from around the world to fund their projects through decentralized smart contracts.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilizing Solidity for secure and efficient transactions.
- **Next.js Framework**: A React framework for production-level front-end development.
- **Semantic UI**: For sleek and responsive styling.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system which will include npm, allowing you to install all the dependencies.

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/semihorhanbio/kickstart
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd kickstart
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project

To run the project on your local server, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server on http://localhost:3000.

### Smart Contract Development

The smart contracts are written in Solidity. Make sure you have Truffle installed globally for compiling and deploying contracts if you wish to modify them.
